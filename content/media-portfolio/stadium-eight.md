testimonial: “I feel free to concentrate on the work of reaching out to my audience and helping my clients. You really took the time to understand who I am, and therefore, what my business is here to do. You took a genuine interest in my goals to help people, and worked with me to gently bring out things about my brand that I was unable to articulate on my own. You have a wealth of knowledge from your different life experiences, which I appreciate. Your perspective is very valuable to health coaches like me.”


clientGoal: "Anton’s project was a startup endeavor to build a national esports league. He had spent months preparing games and acquiring sponsors but never really had the opportunity to create a website himself. He was ready for a website that acurately reflected the brand of Stadium Eight but also had practical applications so that is updated according to their needs throughout each season. He also wanted a website that’s easy to update so that adding new content, upcoming events, and matchups would no longer feel overwhelming. And of course, he wanted his new website to help him attract more players, coaches, and sponsors."

beforeDescription: "Until we started working together, Anton’s website had never been a priority in his business. He had been opting for low-cost, temporary fixes and using templates that never quite felt like the Stadium Eight brand. “Before working with you, my team was extremely overwhelmed with all of the features we wanted our website to have. We had no real idea of what we wanted or needed the website to be. We just wanted potential partners and players to be able to access resources and understand what Stadium Eight is. This made us feel stuck in our business. We weren’t looking forward to writing or updating content on our website.“"

moodBoardDescription: "Estatic to design a website that would help thrust the world towards the future of gaming through the amazing work Anton and his team had been doing - complete with a fresh brand kit, polished messaging and copy, and carefully curated imagery - we kicked off the design process by putting together a few pictures for inspiration."

guidelinesDescription: "We chose dark colors because Stadium Eight is in the world of gaming. To create a futuristic, energetic look that matches Anton’s confidence and excitement, we used Work Sans for headings and Roboto for body text." 

brandDescription: "The primary logo is bold  and unique, just like the work Stadium Eight has done. The combination of heavy lines and bright colors gives the brand a modern and eye-catching aesthetic. While the bold, work sans font adds balance. The icon was perfect for the navbar and for instances where we needed a small version. For the brand mark, we created an abstract shape, which is a special and personal symbol for Anton. The  blue and red colors were a nod to the tradtional colors of two opossing sides in most sports such as the NBA, Tae Kwon Do, and even politics."

stockDescription: "She and I also worked together to ensure that her stock photo collection was consistent with our shared value of fostering diverse and inclusive communities. We used images that accurately and realistically reflects Meredith’s audience. Anton wanted her brand personality to match the gaming culture of dark colors with light neon-like accents. This is what I used to anchor the stock photography. We worked together to ensure that her stock photo collection"
